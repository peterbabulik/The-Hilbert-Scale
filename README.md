# The-Hilbert-Scale
**A benchmarking script visualizing the exponential data capacity of quantum states. It demonstrates how Hilbert Space grows from storing 2 floating-point numbers (1 Qubit) to over 2 million numbers (20 Qubits) in a single state vector.**


**Physics of Information Storage**

It demonstrates the fundamental power of Quantum Computing: **Exponential Scaling**.
*   1 Qubit = 2 numbers
*   10 Qubits = 1,024 numbers
*   20 Qubits = 1,048,576 numbers
*   30 Qubits = 1 Billion numbers (would crash Colab RAM, so stopping at 20 is wise).

**Quantum Capacity Log**

**`The-Hilbert-Scale`**
It answers the question: *"Why bother with Quantum?"*
**Answer:** Because adding **1 qubit** doubles your storage space. Adding **10 qubits** multiplies it by 1000. It is the only technology in the universe that scales this way.
